        <h3>What makes Lasagne <em>sooo</em> good?</h3>
        <p>With ancient Greek origins, the modern, layered dish evolved in the Middle Ages in Italy. The early versions 
            lacked tomatoes and béchamel, but the lasagne we know today, with its meat ragù and <em>creamy</em> sauce, was 
            perfected in the late 19th century in Italy's Emilia-Romagna region.</p>
        <p>The harmonious layering of textures and flavors helps keep this dish as a regular contender of perfection. 
            Each bite combines tender pasta, rich meat sauce, and creamy béchamel, all tied together with melted cheese.
            This intricate balance of savory, creamy, and salty notes, combined with its status as a comforting, home-cooked 
            meal, makes lasagne a truly satisfying culinary experience.</p>

        </ul></p>

                <p><strong><em>For the Assembley:</em></strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lasagne sheets:</strong> 9-12 sheets (depending on the size of your dish and how many layers you want)</li>

        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Ragu:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large pan and cook the onion, carrot, and 
                celery until soft, about 5-7 minutes. Add the ground meat and brown it, breaking it up with a spoon. 
                Stir in the garlic, tomato puree, canned tomatoes, and beef stock. Season and simmer for at least 30 minutes, 
                or longer for a richer flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Bechamel:</strong> In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in 
                the flour and cook for a minute to form a roux. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to create a 
                smooth sauce. Bring to a simmer, whisking, until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch 
                of nutmeg.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagne:</strong></li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200C (400F)</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of Ragu on the baking dish</li>
                <li>Place a layer of lasagne sheets over the sauce</li>
                <li>Top with a layer of Bechamel sauce, and then another layer of Ragu</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers, starting with lasagne sheets, until all ingredients are used. Finish with a final 
                    layer of Bechamel sauce, and cover the top with the shredded Mozarella and Parmesan</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 30-45 minutes, 
                or until the top is golden-brown and bubbling and a knife can easily slide through the pasta. Let it 
                rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol></p>
